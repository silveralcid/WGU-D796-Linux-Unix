## About the Project

This project was completed for **WGU’s D796 – Linux and Unix**, demonstrating system administration and automation using **Bash shell scripting**.
The tasks covered user and environment management, network diagnostics, system maintenance, and file archiving—all implemented with error handling, validation, and modular design.

The project focuses on practical command-line proficiency and automation techniques used in Linux-based environments, preparing for real-world DevOps and system administration workflows.

## Course Information

**Course:** D796 – Linux and Unix
**Focus:** Linux system configuration, package management, shell scripting, and automation fundamentals.

### Competencies

**Shell Scripting and Automation**
The graduate designs and implements Bash scripts to automate administrative tasks and system checks.

**System Administration**
The graduate performs user management, package installation, and environment configuration in Linux/Unix systems.

**File and Process Management**
The graduate applies commands to manipulate files, monitor system resources, and manage processes efficiently.

**Networking and System Maintenance**
The graduate implements scripts to test connectivity, assess disk usage, and manage archive operations.

## Task Overview

### User Management

* `create_user.sh` – Creates new users, assigns groups, and initializes secure passwords with forced resets.
* `delete_user.sh` – Safely removes user accounts and associated home directories with confirmation prompts.
* `.bashrc` Customization – Configures environment variables and login messages for new sessions.

### Package and System Configuration

* Demonstrated package installation and system updates using `apt` with version verification.
* Ensured environment persistence through profile script configuration.

### Network Connectivity Scripts

* `check_google.sh` – Pings google.com to verify external connectivity.
* `check_google_dns_ip.sh` – Tests reachability to Google’s DNS at 8.8.8.8.
* `check_example_dns.sh` – Validates domain resolution using `nslookup`.

### Maintenance and Disk Utilities

* `assess_cleanup.sh` – Assesses free disk space, cleans logs and cache directories, and reports reclaimed storage.
* `archive_compare.sh` – Archives `/etc` using both GZIP and BZIP2, compares compression efficiency, and reports results.

### Demonstration

All scripts were demonstrated live via Panopto with full screen and webcam visibility, showing execution, output validation, and cleanup procedures.

## Learning Summary

This course developed proficiency in **Bash scripting**, **user administration**, **network troubleshooting**, and **system maintenance** on Linux systems.
It emphasized the principles of **secure scripting**, **automation**, and **command-line efficiency**, forming a strong foundation for system engineering and DevOps roles.
